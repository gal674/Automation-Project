🧪 Automation Project – Gal Eppstein
This repository contains the complete automation testing project I developed as part of my QA certification at Bar-Ilan University.

The project showcases my ability to design, implement, and run a full suite of automated UI tests using Python, Selenium, and industry-standard tools and practices.

🚀 Project Overview
The test suite includes:

✅ Functional testing of a custom-built local website (web/)

🌐 Automation of real-world websites (dictionary, Wikipedia, and more)

🔄 Independent test cases, each focused on validating specific features

📁 Project Structure
Automation-Project-Gal-Eppstein/
├── web/                # Local website to test (open with Live Server)
├── outside_webs/       # Test scripts for online websites
├── test_download.py    # Tests the file download functionality
├── test_form.py        # Tests form input and validation
├── test_home.py        # Tests homepage elements and logic
├── test_next_page.py   # Tests navigation and content on the next page
├── test_dictionary.py  # Automates an online dictionary site
├── test_jerusalem.py   # Tests a site related to Jerusalem info
├── test_wiki.py        # Automates functionality on Wikipedia

⚙️ How to Run the Project
Unzip the project folder.

Open the web/ folder with VS Code, then start the Live Server extension.

Once the local site is running, the automated tests can be executed.

Open the main project folder (excluding web/) using PyCharm or your preferred Python IDE.

Run each test file individually. The tests are fully independent and self-explanatory via in-line comments (#) and function names.

🧪 Test Details
Local Site Tests (Live Server)
test_download.py: Validates file download functionality.

test_form.py: Checks form behavior, input validation, and error handling.

test_home.py: Verifies homepage layout and elements.

test_next_page.py: Tests navigation and page-to-page interactions.

External Site Tests
test_dictionary.py: Interacts with an online dictionary and tests definitions and input behavior.

test_jerusalem.py: Focuses on a tourism/informational website.

test_wiki.py: Runs tests against Wikipedia's search and article structure.

👨‍💻 Technologies Used
Python 

Selenium WebDriver

VS Code (Live Server)

🎓 About the Project
This project represents my personal QA journey and growth during my studies. It's a reflection of my hands-on knowledge in:

Automatic testing

Test planning and structuring

Writing clean, maintainable test code

Automating real and simulated environments

Debugging, validation, and issue documentation

I'm proud of this work, and I hope it gives a clear view of my testing approach, attention to detail, and technical abilities.
